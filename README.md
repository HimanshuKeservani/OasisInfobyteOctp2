## Dataset Name: India Unemployment Dataset

Description:
The India Unemployment Dataset provides insights into the unemployment rates in various states across India. It offers a valuable resource for analyzing the impact of economic factors and external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on employment opportunities in different regions of the country. This dataset is essential for understanding labor market dynamics and making data-driven decisions.

Columns:

Region: This column represents the different states within India, indicating the geographical regions for which unemployment rates are recorded.

Date: The Date column specifies the date on which the unemployment rate was observed, allowing for temporal analysis and trend identification.

Frequency: This column denotes the measuring frequency, which is "Monthly" in this dataset, signifying that unemployment rates are recorded on a monthly basis.

Estimated Unemployment Rate (%): The Estimated Unemployment Rate column provides the percentage of people who are unemployed in each state of India during the specified time frame.

Estimated Employed: This column represents the percentage of people who are employed in each state.

Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%): The Estimated Labour Participation Rate column calculates the labor force participation rate by dividing the number of people actively participating in the labor force by the total number of people eligible to participate in the labor force.

Usage:
The India Unemployment Dataset is a critical resource for economists, policymakers, and researchers interested in labor market analysis. It can be used to examine the impact of economic events, government policies, and other factors on employment trends in different Indian states.
